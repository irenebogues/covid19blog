<p>In the blink of an eye, the coronavirus has not only disrupted our daily lives both personally and professionally, but it’s dealt a mortal blow to how corporations literally “work”. Here are a few insights from Infosys XD’s Employee Experience we would like to pass on:  

<p> •	The New Work/Life Balance: In order to successfully work from home, it’s important to partition key aspects of your everyday life from your work objectives. You must not only define what it is that actually must be accomplished from a work standpoint (on a given day, at a given time, or within a period of time) but also recognize that key elements from your personal life will intervene if you allow them to. Your dog needs to go out, your lunch needs to be made, the buzzer rings and you have to go downstairs to pick up a package. We used to believe that a work/life balance meant juggling our workplace priorities after 5 or 6 pm and on the weekends. Given our new reality, we now need to think about work/life balance during our 9-5 shift too. Of course, work hours are still for work, and to gain your utmost productivity from home you must successfully navigate any personal distractions, take scheduled breaks to recharge and maintain a focused, yet nimble mindset that ensures you can quickly regain your productive edge when life intervenes.

<p> •	Don’t Reinvent the Wheel: Our coworkers and supervisors all have productivity tips that may help us partition our work lives from the common distractions of our personal lives. Action: Have a conversation with your boss or coworkers to share ideas on best “work from home” practices and ask whether or not they have some productivity and prioritization tips they wouldn’t mind sharing. Remember that everyone works a bit differently and some methods are far better suited to some employees than others. Don’t be afraid to find out what works best for you. 

<p> •	Create a Routine: As we pack in amongst our loved ones, it’s crucial to create and maintain routines that support our productivity and mental and physical wellbeing. Your routine could be starting off with a given amount of yoga or exercise in the morning, taking a coffee and newspaper break, returning emails for the first 30 minutes of every day, establishing time blocks and prioritizing your to-do list, getting outside the house for lunch whenever possible, walking the dog or allowing your last break for some social media. The important thing is that your routine is a repeated formula that works for you. Our brains function better when we set them up for bumper bowling…in other words we rig the system by putting a system in place to keep our mental bowling ball in the lane rather than in the gutter, which gives us less to think or worry about, because, hey, we have a system for that. Action: Create your routine and review and modify the various elements at the end of the week according to how productive you felt, how focused you were and how engaged you were at various times throughout the day or week. 

<p> •	Your Personal Workspace: To function effectively from home we need to get over our former concept of what an “office” is or what the term even means in todays hyperconnected world. As we shelter from home together with our loved ones, we need to think about creating our own defined workspace. That could mean one side of the kitchen table, or that living room chair with the side table. It may mean the bedroom, porch or balcony. The ultimate question one needs to ask is what type of work we are intent on accomplishing… (conference calls, writing, research, a presentation) and determine what would be the best physical environment in our home for that particular task. Action: For one week conduct a self-assessment of where exactly you work best for the various activities you usually perform. For example, I still have a desk for concentrated writing and another space for reading and brainstorming. Action: Try utilizing a whiteboard for those activities requiring planning, strategizing or conveying ideas to either a team member or client.

<p> •	Timekeeping & Breaks: To gain greater productivity you might want to use a timer block, allowing for 15, 20 or 30 minutes of concentrated time for a certain task, like responding to emails. Then use another timer block to set a brief break period of 5, 10 or 15 minutes. Take frequent breaks throughout the day, making sure to remove yourself from your workspace, stretch and take a walk. To stay fresh and focused, it’s important to reserve your lunch period for lunch. Studies show that workers who try to accomplish work during their lunch breaks usually extend their lunch periods and accomplish very little work and even less relaxation. For example, I spend a good deal of my time researching the latest trends in digital technology and need time to process a lot of complex information. My research results and reports improve if I set aside a certain amount of time for concentration followed by a certain amount of time to recharge my batteries. 

<p> •	Wardrobe Function and Form: Working from home means we have much greater latitude over what we can and do wear in our personal office space. I suggest choosing an outfit that’s professional enough that it motivates your “work face” … in other words this outfit makes you feel energetic and engaged, but also ensures your comfort throughout the day. Dressing too comfortably can become a hinderance to Zoom conferences but it can also take the edge off your “productive self.” Curating several similar outfits that make you feel both comfortable and professional will also eliminate decision fatigue, enabling you to concentrate on what really matters in your day. And please, always make sure to dress appropriately (above the pajamas) for that client conference call. And you might want to let anyone else in the household know about your call, lest you subject your coworkers to walking-man-in-boxers wallpaper.

<p> •	Create and Hold to the TBTB (Time Based Task Bucket): Based on my experience, it’s important to allot oneself a well-defined work task that is time bound. That could mean you’ve set aside half your day to complete the first draft of a thought leadership piece, and the first hour after lunch for any revisions. It may mean you allot the first half hour of every morning to returning emails. Simply having a “to-do” list won’t do at all without establishing ideal time segments to each task you’d like to complete. Setting a timer and moving onto your next task (or rest break) will allow you to come back to unfinished projects with a keener, more alert eye later on. Master your time or it will certainly master you. Action: Write down your three most critical tasks for the day and then execute using the TBTB. When you create your list, be sure to add a free hour at the end of the day to review your work, plan your next day’s critical tasks and complete any tasks that you could not complete within your allotted timeframe. 

<p> •	Fitness: One of the great advantages to working from home is gaining that extra time you would normally be commuting to an office and back. I suggest you reserve 30 to 60 minutes of this time to begin or maintain a cardio-based workout such as walking, jogging or cycling. The advantage of walking for at least some of this extra time means more time to think. I have dubbed this TIM (Thoughts Ideas in Motion) – some of our greatest minds all walked great distances daily; think Kant. Particularly now that we’re all sheltering in place and our gyms are closed, it’s crucial that we take the time to reflect and recharge. Studies show that we perform better on our most difficult tasks after a good 20 or 30-minute session of cardio. Working from home is so convenient that it’s too convenient, contributing to a sedentary lifestyle. Getting out of the house to go walking, running, cycling, dancing or swimming will improve our concentration, and later on at night, improve our sleep. Action: Over a month-long period, and with your doctor’s consent, gradually work up to a vigorous cardio routine of walking, rowing, cycling, dancing or running for at least 20 to 30 minutes, at least 4 days a week. Start out very gradually, or in accordance with your fitness level and physician’s input, walking, jogging or cycling just 5 or 6 minutes and add another couple minutes onto your next workout, until your fit enough to complete 20 to 30 minutes. Observe and write down your thoughts and ideas that occur during your workout or winddown walking time. You will be quite surprised by the results. 

<p> This is a very challenging time. Working at home is a wonderful freedom that can allow greater creativity and productivity as long as you set up a system and routine. Covid19 has created many new challenges to large and small enterprises and simultaneously spurred new and innovative ways to get work done…ways of working that won’t disappear even after the pandemic ends. While our freedom to congregate and socialize has been curtailed, our rapid ability to adapt has ensured that productivity in the workplace is now synonymous with productivity at home.
